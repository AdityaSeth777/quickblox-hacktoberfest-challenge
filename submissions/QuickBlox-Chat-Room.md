# QuickBlox Hacktoberfest Challenge Submission: Real-time QuickBlox Chat Room

GitHub handle: **JanumalaAkhilendra**

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Real-time QuickBlox Chat Room with QuickBlox, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Description**:  
This chat application is a real-time messaging platform built with a front-end interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a QuickBlox backend to handle user authentication, message sending, and message retrieval in real time.

## Key Components
QuickBlox Integration:

QuickBlox is used as the backend service to handle user authentication, room creation, and chat messaging.
By leveraging QuickBlox’s SDK, the app can manage real-time communication between users without a custom backend.
Frontend Interface:

The app has a simple HTML structure for user interaction, with a chat input box, a send button, and a message display area.
The messages are styled to differentiate between sent and received messages, enhancing readability.

## Additional Information

**Challenges faced**:  
- **Syncing Messages Across Users**: Ensuring messages show up in real-time for all users without delay or duplication can be difficult. The challenge is compounded when multiple users are involved and network latency comes into play.
- **Session Management**: Handling user sessions, including login and logout, can be tricky with QuickBlox, particularly if you need to manage multiple users concurrently.
- **UI Enhancements**: Designing a clean, user-friendly UI and maintaining it across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) may require a lot of testing and CSS adjustments for responsiveness.

**Future Improvements**:  
- **User Authentication**: Adding optional user authentication to allow for tracking user participation without compromising anonymity.
- **Message Styling**: Differentiate message types, like sent vs. received, by using custom colors, timestamps, or avatars.
- **Theme Options**: Allow users to switch between light and dark modes, or even customize themes.
